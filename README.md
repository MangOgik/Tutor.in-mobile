# Tutor.In - RN Mobile App UI

Tutor.In is a React Native Expo mobile application built with TypeScript, designed to support university students in learning through a flexible and effective platform. This repository focuses on the user interface (UI) development, providing a clean and intuitive design for features like peer tutoring forums and opportunities for high-achieving students to become tutors. Note: This project currently contains only the UI without integrated logic.
